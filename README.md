I
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
     Android development, network security tools, audio synthesis (synthesizer) programs. 
     
     Also, I'm big Destiny 2 player and DIM user so as a programmer I am drawn to the idea of developing an app or browser plug-in to help the D2community in some way.
     The idea that's been slowly coming into reality (due to my personal need of it) is an armor roll ranking appraiser, sort of similar to light.gg's roll appraiser but
     for armor rolls instead of weapons. After years of grinding this game, I need help dealing with the tricky problem of having accumulated too much really good armor
     pieces (some maybe nearly identical) and not knowing which to keep or dismantle by a quick look at the stat distribution alone.
